duck, dm you. The F135 originated with Lockheed Corporation Skunk Works, with efforts to develop a stealthy STOVL strike fighter for the U.S. Marine Corps under a 1986 DARPA project under the auspices of the Advanced STOVL (ASTOVL) program, an early progenitor of the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) that resulted in the F-35. Lockheed engineer Paul Bevilaqua developed and eventually patented a concept aircraft and a propulsion system called the Shaft-Driven Lift Fan (SDLF), and then turned to Pratt & Whitney (P&W) to build a demonstrator engine.[5][6] The ground test demonstrator used the first stage fan from a F119 engine for the lift fan. The engine fan and core from the F100-PW-220 were used for the core of the demonstrator engine, and the larger low-pressure turbine from the F100-PW-229 was used for the low-pressure turbine of the demonstrator engine. The larger turbine was used to provide the additional power required to operate the lift fan through the low-pressure spool shaft, which would be engaged by a clutch in STOVL mode. Finally, a variable thrust deflecting nozzle was added to complete the "F100-229-Plus" demonstrator engine.[N 1] This ground demonstrator engine proved the shaft-driven lift fan concept and led to the development of the eventual JSF engine.[8]
