Role (IT(employee), www-data, root)

Local backup server
Cloud server
Window (employee, client)

Cloud: 
	IT
	access: system maintenance, bug fix

Two C++ program
	Linux(cloud) send socket heartbeat, and "Allahu Akbar" (C++)
	windows(client) receive socket heartbeat (C++)

[No need sync]

Step 1:
Create a file name(passwd, key, classified) in the web-server

Step2:
File permission only allow (root, www-data)(read, write)

Step3:
C++ program run in root permission to scan access of the file
C++ scan (read, write) (socket Heartbeat)

Step4:
File or C++ code should only be contain create date(no read or write) for both file
If C++ was found it will stop the (heartbeat) which cause "Allahu Akbar"

Step5:
Window(client) if heartbeat stopped then notify IT employee or admin for backup time
